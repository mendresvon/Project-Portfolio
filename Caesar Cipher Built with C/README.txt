This project is essentially a Caesar Cipher Program written in C. 

A Caesar cipher is used to encrypt confidential and secret messages by shifting every letter by some number of places.
For example:
  A Caesar cipher with a key of one (1), would shift the message "abc" into "bcd", therefore moving the the letter by a place of one which is the "key".
  The receiver can then decode the encrypted message "bcd" back into "abc" if he knows the key that was used (which is one (1) in this case).
  That is why the encryption key of a caesar cipher message must be kept a secret!

  1. The way the program works is that, it takes one command-line argument which is the key to your secret message! So keep it a secret.

  2. You then enter the plaintext or the original form of the message that you want to encrypt using the key. 

  3. The program does its magic and prints out your encrypted text which you can now send to your friends and give them the key for them to unlock your secret message!
 
 That's about it and welcome to the Project!
